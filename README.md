# 🌐 Week 1 - Introduction to Web Development and HTML

Welcome to my first web development assignment! This week's focus was on understanding the structure of HTML documents and creating simple web pages.

## 📁 What’s Inside?

This folder contains the following HTML files:

- **index.html** – The homepage of the website.
- **about us.html** – A basic page describing the team or organization.
- **services.html** – A list of services offered.
- **contact.html** – A simple contact page.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this assignment was to:

- Learn the structure of an HTML document.
- Practice using semantic HTML tags.
- Link multiple HTML files together using anchor tags.
- Build a basic multi-page website layout.

## 📌 How to View

You can open any of the HTML files in a browser by double-clicking them or right-clicking and selecting `Open With → Browser`.

Start by opening `index.html`, which links to the other pages.
